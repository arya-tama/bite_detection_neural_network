# bite_detection_neural_network
This is further development of online bine detection algorithm. In this work, a simple two-layer neural network is proposed for prediction of bite and non-bite segment over a chewing sequence.

## Requirements
tensorflow 1.15.0,
numpy,
h5py,
pandas,
matplotlib

## Wiki
Run TensorFlow_BiteDetection.ipynb to see algorithm's workflow step by step. Hypermarameters can be adjusted to give different results in training and testing process.

## Future work

Future work includes test in different architectures of deep neural network, including recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory models (LSTM)
